    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how player engagement on game servers is crucial for successful communication strategies, such as newsletter campaigns. Players choose to subscribe to a newsletter for updates, research information, and community links. Discovering which player profiles subscribe will aid researchers in more effectively reaching and retaining committed participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores whether player characteristics, specifically **player age** and **time spent playing**, can be used to predict if a player will subscribe to the game newsletter. By analyzing this relationship, we can identify which age groups are most engaged with the game and could be the most responsive to future newsletter campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from a Minecraft research server managed by the UBC PLAI group (https://plaicraft.ai), which collects information about players' \n",
    "demographics and statistics. This analysis will focus on the **players.csv dataset**, which contains demographic information such as players' age, subscription status, and the amount of time played. Once the data has been cleaned, wrangled, and prepared, we will apply the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classification model to examine whether age and playtime predict newsletter subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question of Interest:** Is there a relationship between the age of players and the time they spend playing that could inform which group of players to target for newsletter subscription campaigns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Response Variable: 'subscribe'\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanatory Variable: 'Age', 'played_hours'"

    "## Methods and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we loaded the **players.csv** dataset and selected the variables needed for the classification model. There were some players who had missing values for 'age' and 'played_hours', so these were removed. Additionally, we have decided to convert the 'subscribe' indicator to a categorical variable and filtered out players with zero playtime, since they provide no meaningful information."
